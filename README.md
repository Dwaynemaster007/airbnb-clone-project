## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend: Project Blueprint

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This system will handle the core logic and data for the application.

### Project Goals üèÜ

* **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profiles.
* **Property Management:** Develop features for listing, updating, and retrieving properties.
* **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism and manage booking details.
* **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle secure transactions.
* **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

### Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **Framework:** Django with Django REST Framework for building a RESTful API.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL for powerful relational data storage.
* **Query Language:** GraphQL for flexible and efficient data querying.
* **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery for handling background tasks.
* **Caching:** Redis for caching and session management to boost performance.
* **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
* **Automation:** CI/CD Pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Features Overview üìã

1.  **API Documentation:** The APIs are documented using OpenAPI and offer both RESTful and GraphQL endpoints.
2.  **User Authentication:** Endpoints for user registration, authentication, and profile management (`/users/`).
3.  **Property Management:** Endpoints to create, update, and delete property listings (`/properties/`).
4.  **Booking System:** Endpoints to manage bookings, including check-in/out details (`/bookings/`).
5.  **Payment Processing:** Endpoints for handling payment transactions (`/payments/`).
6.  **Review System:** Endpoints for posting and managing property reviews (`/reviews/`).
